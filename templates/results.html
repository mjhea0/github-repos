			<p><strong>What is this?</strong><p>
			<p>Your Github Repositories.</p>
			<p><strong>Why did I make this?</strong><p>
			<p>One way that I learn is by looking at how other people solve problems. I created this for myself, but thought that others may learn in the same way as I do. Sharing is caring. Right?</p>
			<p><strong>How did I do this?</strong><p>
			<p>In short, I consumed the Github API and parsed the returned JSON data. It's built with Python using a web framework called Flask. If you want to know more, just ask.</p>
			<p><strong>How is the data organized?</strong><p>
			<p>If your repo has the name "refactor" (case insensitive) in it, you should see it in the list. I used a quick and dirty method of retrieving the data, as well as parsing and organizing it. My goal is to use a more sophisticated means of organizing the data and delivering it in a more logical manner, unless Matt "the Empire" Null builds out this functionality into the student portal.</p>
			<br>
			<p><em>Updates are in real time. When you add a repo, this app will automatically add it to the list.</em></p>
